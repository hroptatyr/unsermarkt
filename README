unsermarkt is a set of tools, snippets, modules that utilise unserding
beef channels (ad-hoc multicast networks) to produce meaningful chains
of business processes  like tick data acquisition, data consolidation,
trading strategies, and order processing.

Should there be gems in this repository one day, chances are they will
be refactored into dedicated projects.
